kNN From Scratch <br>
(1)To Predict Digits from images of handwritten digits in the dataset (MNIST dataset) <br>
(2) To Clssify set of features of a Mushroom dataset

A KNN based classifier has been implemented from scratch
* The images are featurized as vectors in the dataset, and can be used for classification.
* Experimentation with different values of K(number of neighbors) has been done to find the best suited k
* Euclidean Distance and Manhattan distances have been used to measure the ditance. Majority voting is done to pick the best match from k Nearest Neighbors

Accuracy: 96.3%
