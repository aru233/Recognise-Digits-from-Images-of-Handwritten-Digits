# kNN-From-Scratch-To-Predict-Digits

A KNN based classifier has been implemented to predict digits from images of handwritten digits in the dataset.

The images are featurized as vectors in the dataser, and can be used for classification.

Experimentation with different values of K(number of neighbors) has been done to find the best suited k

Majority voting is done to pick the best match from k Nearest Neighbors
